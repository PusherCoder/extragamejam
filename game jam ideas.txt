---------------
- POTION GAME -
---------------
Player takes on contracts to create potions to deal with patient illnesses. They have a list of reagents which each affect patient humors. Illnesses 
are created by a humor imbalance, the player is trying to rebalance the patient's humors without sending any other humors out of balance. Reagents each
have a cost, so the player is insentivized to make the cheapest potion possible.

How it fits the theme: Player is "taking care" of their patients

Required features:
- Potion recipe making UI
- Reference text (player can refer to this to figure out what causes symptoms and what effects reagents have)
- Contract interface (allows the player to take on new patients)
- Shop interface (maybe players buy reagents directly as they make a potion)
	~ Note keeping interface (somewhere players can make note of what they need to buy, only required if shop is separate interface)

Optional features:
- Proc-gen illnesses
- Non-reagent potion steps (like distillation) that affect the outcome of the potion
- Hidden story (e.g. someone is trying to kill off royal family, uncover plot based on illnesses)
- Adventure mode (player can go out into world and collect reagents by picking plants and killing monsters)

Pros:
- Low art requirements 
- Fairly original (kinda like Big Pharma but not quite)

Cons:
- Will require in depth tutorial
- Mental investment might be too high, player bounce off
