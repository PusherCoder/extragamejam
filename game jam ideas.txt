-----------------
- BATTLE CLERIC -
-----------------
Player is healer in dungeon delving group. The player is incapable of beating the dungeon[s] on their own so they need to make sure their party members survive.
Possibly old school fps visuals (Doom/OG Elder scrolls). 

How it fits the theme: Player is "taking care" of their party members

Required features:
- At least one dungeon with at least one boss
- First person movement
- Party member AI
- Enough player abilites to keep things interesting (e.g. a direct heal, a heal over time, etc)

Option features:
- Multiple dungeons/bosses
- Loot

Pros:
- Low/mid art requirements
- Once we've got a working version, we can extend onto it easily
- Low tutorial requirments 

Cons:
- AI

---------------
- POTION GAME -
---------------
Player takes on contracts to create potions to deal with patient illnesses. They have a list of reagents which each affect patient humors. Illnesses 
are created by a humor imbalance, the player is trying to rebalance the patient's humors without sending any other humors out of balance. Reagents each
have a cost, so the player is insentivized to make the cheapest potion possible.

How it fits the theme: Player is "taking care" of their patients

Required features:
- Potion recipe making UI
- Reference text (player can refer to this to figure out what causes symptoms and what effects reagents have)
- Contract interface (allows the player to take on new patients)
- Shop interface (maybe players buy reagents directly as they make a potion)
	~ Note keeping interface (somewhere players can make note of what they need to buy, only required if shop is separate interface)

Optional features:
- Proc-gen illnesses
- Non-reagent potion steps (like distillation) that affect the outcome of the potion
- Hidden story (e.g. someone is trying to kill off royal family, uncover plot based on illnesses)
- Adventure mode (player can go out into world and collect reagents by picking plants and killing monsters)

Pros:
- Low art requirements 
- Fairly original (kinda like Big Pharma but not quite)

Cons:
- Will require in depth tutorial
- Mental investment might be too high, player bounce off

-        JUST BREATHE       -
-----------------------------
You play as the autonomous nervous system of an anonymous person with anxiety problem. As they go about their daily routine, you use up to four keyboard keys
to control various functions of their body. Examples would be blinking, breathing, heartbeat, farting (sure), digestion, and perspiration. Each function is
bound to a keyboard key, and the player is given a DDR-esque graphic to show which keys they should be pressing, when they should be pressing them, and how
long they should be holding them. If the player does NOT hold the correct keys down at the correct times, a health bar for that key drains. Once it reaches
zero, the game ends.

The levels of the game consist of the anonymous person going through several different tasks. Things like waking up, running, having a difficult conversation,
and cooking can focus on different combinations of autonomous functions. On easier levels, the functions will sync up in a rhythm-like fashion, but in later
levels the functions will be skewed and offset from each other.

During the course of the level, the player will be set upon by a random anxiety attack. These anxieties take the form of something similar to the witch familiars
from Madoka Magica (real f***ed up paper cutout abominations), which will swarm the screen. They can do anything from messing with the cycle of an input to just
obstructing parts of the interface in general. The mouse will be used to try and ward them away, and doing so will reward the player with a brief reduction in
difficulty and a soothing music prelude.

How it fits the theme: Player is "taking care" of themselves mentally 

Pros:
- Once we've got a working version, we can extend onto it easily
- Base programming is relatively straightforward
- Relatable

Cons:
- Have to nail feeling of anxiety
- Graphics will have to be pretty good to convey the message of the game
- Sound design will be crucial
